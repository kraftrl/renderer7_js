Programming Assignment 1<br>
CS 45500<br>
Computer Graphics<br>
Fall, 2021
</h1>

<p>
This assignment makes use of the files contained in this <a href="hw1.zip">zip file</a>.
This assignment is due Thursday, September 9.
</p>

<p>
This assignment and your next assignment are about the data structures used at the two ends of the 3D graphics rendering pipeline; what goes into the beginning of the pipeline and what comes out of the end of the pipeline. Roughly, what goes into the pipeline is the <code>Scene</code> data structure which describes the geometry of what the renderer should draw. What comes out of the pipeline is the <code>FrameBuffer</code> data structure which holds the image of the scene drawn by the renderer. This assignment is  about what comes out of the graphics pipeline, the <code>FrameBuffer</code> data structure. Assignment 2 will be about what goes into the rendering pipeline, the <code>Scene</code> data structure.
</p>

<p>
A <code><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framebuffer">FrameBuffer</a></code> object holds an array of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel">pixel</a> data that represents an image that can be displayed on a computer's screen. For each pixel in the image, the FrameBuffer's array holds <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp">three bytes</a>, one byte that represents the red component of the pixel's color, one byte that represents the green component, and one byte that represents the blue component of the pixel's color. Each of these three bytes is only eight bits in size, so each of the three colors has only 256 shades (but there are 256^3 = 16,777,216 distinct colors). If a framebuffer has dimensions of <code>n</code> rows of pixels by <code>m</code> columns of pixels, then the framebuffer's array holds <code>n*m</code> integers and each integer holds the three bytes for one pixel (with one unused byte in each integer). The pixel data is NOT stored as a "two-dimensional" (or "three-dimensional") array. It is stored as a one-dimensional integer array of length <code>n*m</code>. This one-dimensional array is in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-_and_column-major_order">row major</a> form, meaning that the first <code>m</code> integers in the array are the pixels from the image's first (top) row. The next <code>m</code> integers from the array are the pixels from the image's second row, etc. Finally, the last <code>m</code> integers in the array are the pixels from the image's last (bottom) row of pixels as displayed on the computer's screen.
</p>

<p>
In this assignment you are to write a program that creates a <code>FrameBuffer</code> object and then fills it with pixel data so that the resulting image looks like the file <code>Hw1_demo.ppm</code> from the zip file. In the zip file there is a file <code>Hw1.java</code> that you need to complete. In <code>Hw1.java</code> there is a brief outline of what you need to do. You should make as much use of the <code>FrameBuffer</code> interface as possible when you write your code. To learn about the <code>FrameBuffer</code> class's interface, look at its source code in the <code>framebuffer</code> sub folder of the zip file. You should also create and look at the Javadoc html file for the <code>FrameBuffer</code> class. The <code>FrameBuffer.java</code> class file contains a <code>main()</code> method that tests the code in the class. Read the <code>main()</code> method carefully because it is also a good demonstration of how to write code that uses the <code>FrameBuffer</code> and its <code>Viewport</code> nested class.
</p>

<p>
Your program should produce a result that looks exactly like <code>Hw1_demo.ppm</code>. There are a number of facts about the image in <code>Hw1_demo.ppm</code> that you need to find out (like, what are the exact colors?). Use tools from <a href="http://math.pnw.edu/~rlkraft/cs45500/for-class/pixel-utilities.zip">pixel-utilities.zip</a> to determine these details about <code>Hw1_demo.ppm</code>.
</p>

<p>
Notice that the program <code>Hw1.java</code> takes a command-line argument which is the name of the file to imbed into the final picture. This lets you run the program using either the <code>RebelTrooper.ppm</code> file or the <code>Hulk.ppm</code> file. Your final version of <code>Hw1.java</code> must use that command-line argument. I will test your program to make sure it is getting the file name from the command-line, and not hard-coding the file name into the code.
</p>

<p>
When you copy pixel data from <code>RebelTrooper.ppm</code> (or <code>Hulk.ppm</code>) framebuffer into the main framebuffer, you should only copy a pixel if it is not a background pixel. For the most part, the background pixels are white (the color with (r, g, b) = (255, 255, 255)). But some of the background pixels near the image are not quite exactly white. For example, a background pixel very near the image might be (252, 251, 254). In order to get a good sharp "cutout" of the image, it helps to not copy any pixel that is "nearly" white.
<p>

<p>
The last step of creating the final image it to add Dumbledore's "ghost". Put the Dumbledore pixel data in its own <code>FrameBuffer</code> object. Then create a viewport the covers the area where Dumbledore should appear. Then use two nested for-loops to simultaneously step through the pixels of the Dumbledore framebuffer and the Dumbledore viewport. For each pixel from the Dumbledore framebuffer, if that pixel is not white (or not almost white) then blend that pixel from the framebuffer with the corresponding pixel from the viewport. Blend them with 70% weight on the framebuffer pixel and 30% weight on the viewport pixel. So if <code>c1</code> is the pixel color from the framebuffer and <code>c2</code> is the color from the viewport, then blend them (more or less) like this (for the red component, similarly for the green and blue components),
</p>
<pre>
<code>
      new_red = 0.7*c1.getRed() + 0.3*c2.getRed()
</code>
</pre>
<p>
After you compute the new blended color components, you write that new color into the viewport's pixel. By averaging Dumbledore's pixels with the pixels already in the framebuffer, you create the effect of a "see-through" ghost of Dumbledore superimposed on the framebuffer's contents.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://math.pnw.edu/~rlkraft/cs45500/handin.html">Turn in</a> a zip file called <code>CS455Hw1Surname.zip</code> (where <code>Surname</code> is your last name) containing your version of <code>Hw1.java</code>.
