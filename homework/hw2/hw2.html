Programming Assignment 2<br>
CS 45500<br>
Computer Graphics<br>
Fall, 2021
</h1>

<p>
This assignment makes use of the files contained in this <a href="hw2.zip">zip file</a>.
This assignment is due Tuesday, October 5.
</p>

<p>
This assignment and your previous assignment are about the data structures used at the two ends of the 3D graphics rendering pipeline; what goes into the beginning of the pipeline and what comes out of the end of the pipeline. Roughly, what goes into the pipeline is the <code>Scene</code> data structure which describes the geometry of what the renderer should draw. What comes out of the pipeline is the <code>FrameBuffer</code> data structure which holds the pixel image of the scene drawn by the renderer. The previous assignment was about just the <code>FrameBuffer</code> data structure. This assignment is about what goes into the rendering pipeline, the <code>Scene</code> and <code>Model</code> data structures.
</p>

<p>
For this assignment, you will define several <code>Model</code> data structures that represent fractal shapes and then test your models in an interactive <code>Scene</code>.
</p>

<p>
As we have said in class, a <code>Scene</code> is a collection of models. A <code>Model</code> is a list of vertices in 3-dimensional space (which we call "camera space") and a list of line segments. Each <code>Vertex</code> contains three doubles (for the <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code> coordinates of a point). Each <code>LineSegment</code> contains the (integer) index for each of two <code>Vertex</code> objects from the <code>Model</code>'s vertex list. The vertices and line segments combine to form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire-frame_model">wireframe</a> shape that we see as a geometric object in the scene.
</p>

<p>
In the zip file there is a package, <code>fractals</code>, of seven Java source files. Each of those files defines a sub-class of the <code>Model</code> class from the <code>scene</code> package. The files <code>Canopy.java</code> and <code>KochCurve.java</code> are complete. You need to complete the other five files in the package. These are two-dimensional models (all the vertices are in the xy-plane). For each model, you need to determine the <code>Vertex</code> and <code>LineSegment</code> objects that the model needs and then write the code that instantiates those objects and puts them into the model. Use the two completed models to help you figure out how to complete the other five models. Each model in the package has completed Javadocs. The Javadocs include all the formulas that you need to define the fractal shapes.
</p>

<p>
If you want to see more examples of <code>Model</code> classes, look at the files in the <code>models</code> package in <a href="http://math.pnw.edu/~rlkraft/cs45500/renderer_2.zip">renderer_2.zip</a>. In particular, look at the files <code>Square.java<code>, </code>Circle.java</code>, <code>Cube.java</code>, and <code>Tetrahedron.java</code>, because those are the simplest models.
</p>

<p>
In the zip file there is a program <code>InteractiveModelsAll.java</code> that instantiates examples of all the fractal models. Use this program to interactively test your definitions of the models. Work on one model at a time. Comment out from <code>InteractiveModelsAll.java</code> the code that instantiates models that you have not completed. The program <code>InteractiveModelsAll.java</code> tests the two completed models first, so you can run <code>InteractiveModelsAll.java</code> even before you write any code.
</p>

<p>
In the zip file there is a folder called <code>demo</code> which contains a demo version of the completed assignment. Double click on the file <code>hw2_demo.cmd</code> to run the demo program (you may be able to run the program by double clicking on the <code>hw2_demo.jar</code> file).
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal">Fractals</a> are examples of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion">recursive</a> shapes. Like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_data_type">recursive data structures</a>, recursive shapes are best defined using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)">recursive functions</a>. Defining recursive shapes and recursive data structures using recursive functions is often referred to as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_induction">structural recursion</a>".
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://math.pnw.edu/~rlkraft/cs45500/handin.html">Turn in</a> a zip file called <code>CS455Hw2Surname.zip</code> (where <code>Surname</code> is your last name) containing <code>InteractiveModelsAll.java</code> and your sub folder <code>fractals</code>.
</p>
