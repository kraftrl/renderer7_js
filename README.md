# renderer7_js
HTML5/JavaScript port of [renderer_7.zip](http://math.pnw.edu/~rlkraft/cs45500/for-class/renderer_7.zip) from [CS 45500](http://cs.pnw.edu/~rlkraft/cs45500/class.html)

The goal is to port all of [renderer7](http://math.pnw.edu/~rlkraft/cs45500/for-class/renderer_7.zip) (including the transformation examples from [renderer7](http://math.pnw.edu/~rlkraft/cs45500/for-class/renderer_7.zip), the aspect ratio examples from [renderer6](http://math.pnw.edu/~rlkraft/cs45500/for-class/renderer_6.zip), and homework assignments [hw2](http://math.pnw.edu/~rlkraft/cs45500/homework/hw2.html), [hw3](http://math.pnw.edu/~rlkraft/cs45500/homework/hw3.html), [hw4](http://math.pnw.edu/~rlkraft/cs45500/homework/hw4.html), [hw5](http://math.pnw.edu/~rlkraft/cs45500/homework/hw5.html)) from Java to JavaScript.

Example programs are located in the examples folder. All example programs have a respective HTML document to run them. Assets (OBJ, GRS, JSON) are located in the assets folder.

This project requires a web server to run as modules cannot read the import/export directives when run locally.
